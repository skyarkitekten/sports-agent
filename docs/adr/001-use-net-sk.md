# ADR 001: Use of .NET 9 and Semantic Kernel

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires a robust, scalable, and open-source framework for building web applications. The project also requires a powerful and flexible text processing library for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Also, a key motivation for the project is to produce knowledge and reference materials for the Semantic Kernel agent framework.

## Decision

The project will use .NET 9 as the primary framework for building web applications. The project will also use the Semantic Kernel library for text processing and NLP tasks.

## Consequences

- The project will benefit from .NET 9's advanced features, performance improvements, and active community support.
- The project will benefit from Semantic Kernel's powerful text processing capabilities and support for NLP tasks.
- Team members will need to familiarize themselves with .NET 9 and Semantic Kernel.
- Semantic Kernel agent framework is still experimental and may have bugs or limitations.
